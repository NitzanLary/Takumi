# Takumi — Personal Trading Intelligence Platform

> **IMPORTANT: Keep this file updated.** Whenever you add new packages, change project structure, modify conventions, add services, create new routes/pages, or shift architectural decisions — update the relevant section of this file immediately so future sessions have accurate context. This is a mandatory part of every task.

## What This Is

A multi-user web app for independent investors trading Israeli (TASE) and US (NYSE/NASDAQ) equities through IBI broker. Transactions are imported from IBI's XLSX exports. Provides analytics dashboards and a persistent AI chat agent powered by Claude. All data is per-user — trades, positions, alerts, conversations, and snapshots are scoped by `user_id`.

The full PRD is in `Takumi_PRD.md` at the project root — refer to it for detailed requirements, agent tool definitions (24 tools across 3 tiers), alert types, data enrichment strategy, and example conversations.

## Architecture

```
Browser  →  Next.js web (session cookie gate)  →  rewrites /api/*  →  Express API (private)  →  Postgres
                                                                                ↕
                                                                         Anthropic Claude API
                                                                                ↕
                                                                         Resend (transactional email)
```

- **Frontend** calls relative `/api/*` URLs. Next.js rewrites them server-side to the API service (via `API_URL` env var). The browser never sees the API origin directly. `src/middleware.ts` redirects unauthenticated requests to `/login` (checked via presence of `takumi_session` cookie).
- **Express** is the single gateway. All routes except `/api/health` and `/api/auth/*` require a valid session (enforced by `requireAuth` middleware). `req.user.id` is set on every authenticated request — services accept `userId` as their first argument and every Prisma query scopes by it.
- **Auth** — email + password. Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost 12). Session tokens are 32-byte random strings, stored as SHA-256 hashes in the `sessions` table. Cookie is httpOnly, Secure (prod), SameSite=Lax, 30-day rolling expiry. Verification + password-reset tokens live in `verification_tokens`. **Email verification is currently disabled** (no verified Resend sending domain yet — see "External Services"): signup auto-sets `emailVerifiedAt`, creates a session and logs the user in directly; login and `requireAuth` no longer gate on verification. The verify/reset-password endpoints and pages are still in the codebase and will work again once a domain is verified and `EMAIL_FROM` is pointed at it — the "Forgot?" link on the login page has been hidden in the meantime.
- **Data import** — XLSX files exported from IBI are uploaded via the `/import` page and parsed by `xlsx-import.service.ts`.
- **Database** — Prisma schema is PostgreSQL. Dev and prod both use Postgres (Railway for prod).

## Key Commands

```bash
# Start everything
bash scripts/dev.sh

# Start individual services
pnpm --filter @takumi/api dev          # Express API on :3001
pnpm --filter @takumi/web dev          # Next.js on :3000

# Database
pnpm --filter @takumi/db db:generate   # Regenerate Prisma client
pnpm --filter @takumi/db db:push       # Push schema to SQLite
DATABASE_URL="file:/home/nitzan/Takumi/packages/db/prisma/takumi.db" pnpm --filter @takumi/api exec tsx ../../scripts/seed.ts
```

## Environment Variables

All secrets live in `.env` at project root. The API loads it via `dotenv` in `apps/api/src/lib/config.ts`. Required variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API key |
| `API_PORT` / `WEB_PORT` | Express (:3001) and Next.js (:3000) ports |
| `APP_URL` | Public URL of the web app — embedded into verification + password-reset email links |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend transactional email API key. Unset = email sends become console logs (fine for dev). |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | From address used by Resend (e.g. `"Takumi <onboarding@resend.dev>"`) |
| `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS_USER_ID` | **Dev-only.** If set, `requireAuth` resolves this user without session lookup. Never set in prod. |
| `BOOTSTRAP_USER_EMAIL` / `BOOTSTRAP_USER_PASSWORD` | Consumed only by `scripts/bootstrap-users.ts` (one-time migration to backfill the primary user). |

## Database

Schema in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`. PostgreSQL provider, Prisma ORM.

**Tables (12 total):**

| Table | Purpose | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Accounts | Unique on `email`. Columns: `password_hash` (bcrypt cost 12), `email_verified_at`, `display_name`, `currency_pref`, `cost_basis_method`, timestamps. |
| `sessions` | Active login sessions | `token_hash` = SHA-256 of the opaque cookie value. 30-day expiry with rolling refresh on activity. Cascades on user delete. |
| `verification_tokens` | Email-verify + password-reset tokens | `purpose` ∈ {`email_verify`, `password_reset`}. `token_hash`, `expires_at`, `consumed_at`. Indexed by `(userId, purpose)`. |
| `trades` | All transaction records (trades + non-trades) | Unique on `(userId, tradeId, source)`. `user_id` FK cascades. `direction` field: BUY/SELL for core trades; DIVIDEND, TAX, FEE, TRANSFER, CONVERSION, CREDIT, DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, SPLIT for non-trades. Extra fields: `proceeds_fx`, `proceeds_ils`, `capital_gains_tax`. All services filter to BUY/SELL by default and scope by `userId`. |
| `securities` | Security reference data (shared across users) | Unique on `ticker`. Extended with `yahoo_symbol`, `industry`, `market_cap_bucket` (Phase 3). |
| `sync_log` | Import run history | Per-user. Indexed by `(userId, synced_at DESC)`. Has `file_name` column for tracking imported XLSX filenames. |
| `alerts` | Price/P&L/duration alerts | Per-user. 6 types: price_drop, price_target, holding_duration, portfolio_pnl, sync_failure, inactivity |
| `market_prices` | Cached market prices (shared) | Indexed by `(ticker, fetched_at DESC)`. |
| `exchange_rates` | Daily ILS/USD rates (shared) | Unique on `date` |
| `portfolio_snapshots` | Daily portfolio value snapshots | Per-user, unique on `(userId, date)`. |
| `ai_conversations` | Chat sessions | Per-user, indexed by `(userId, updatedAt)`. Has many `ai_messages`. |
| `ai_messages` | Individual chat messages | Role: user/assistant/tool; optional `tool_calls` JSON. Scoped by conversation (which is per-user). |

All monetary fields use `Decimal` (not Float). The legacy `user_preferences` singleton table was dropped in Commit B — per-user prefs now live on `users.currency_pref` / `users.cost_basis_method`.

## API Routes (Express)

All routes except `/api/health` and `/api/auth/*` require a valid session cookie. `requireAuth` middleware sets `req.user = { id, email }`.

## Frontend Pages

Auth pages (`/login`, `/signup`, `/verify-email`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) are rendered by `AppShell` without the sidebar/topbar chrome. Every other page requires a session cookie — unauthenticated requests are redirected to `/login?next=<original-path>` by `src/middleware.ts`.

| Route | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | **Functional** | Email + password sign-in. Preserves `?next=` for post-login redirect. |
| `/signup` | **Functional** | Email + password + optional display name. Sends verification email; user can't log in until verified. |
| `/verify-email` | **Functional** | Consumes `?token=`, shows success/error state, links to `/login`. |
| `/forgot-password` | **Functional** | Email → reset link. Always shows "check your email" to avoid user enumeration. |
| `/reset-password` | **Functional** | `?token=` + new password + confirm. Invalidates all existing sessions for that user on success. |
| `/dashboard` | **Functional** | Single pane of glass for portfolio state and performance. **Portfolio Total** card (ILS home currency) showing Market Value, Unrealized P&L, Realized P&L, and Total P&L with USD equivalent under each. **Per-market cards** (TASE, US) showing the same four rows in native currency with cross-currency equivalent. **Realized-window toggle** (All-time / YTD / 12M, persisted in URL `?window=`) affects only Realized P&L and Total P&L. Equity curve (Recharts, from portfolio snapshots). Components live in `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/` (`MoneyLine`, `WindowToggle`, `PortfolioTotalCard`, `MarketCard`). |
| `/positions` | **Functional** | Open positions table with live market prices (Yahoo Finance), day change %, unrealized P&L, weight %. Refresh Prices button. Auto-refetch every 60s. Shows placeholder warning for unmapped TASE tickers. Ticker cells link to `/positions/:ticker`. |
| `/positions/:ticker` | **Functional** | Per-stock detail page. Header (shares, avg cost, current price, day change, market value, unrealized P&L, weight, sector, first buy date, holding duration). Tabs: Overview (KPI cards + open FIFO lots), Trades (raw BUY/SELL list), Round-trips (completed buy→sell cycles with holding and return), Dividends & Fees (dividend payments with withheld tax + per-trade commissions). Price chart docked at bottom with green/red buy/sell markers and dashed avg-cost line. Works for open AND closed positions. Also reachable from `/history` and `/analytics` ticker cells. Components in `apps/web/src/components/stock/`. |
| `/history` | **Functional** | Full trade table with filters (ticker/market/direction), pagination, "Show all transactions" toggle for non-trade types. Ticker cells link to `/positions/:ticker`. |
| `/analytics` | **Functional** | Realized P&L summary (per-currency P&L, total/closed trade counts, avg return, avg holding period), behavioral stats (8 cards), TASE vs US comparison, per-ticker P&L breakdown table (ticker cells link to `/positions/:ticker`), monthly P&L heatmap (color-coded grid), risk metrics cards (HHI, drawdown, Sharpe, Sortino) |
| `/import` | **Functional** | XLSX drag-and-drop import with file tracking, import status, import history table |
| `/alerts` | Stub | Empty page |
| `/settings` | Stub | Empty page |

**Layout:** Sidebar (left, 240px wide) + TopBar (56px tall) + main content. Sidebar nav has 7 items.

## Conventions

- **Per-user data scoping (CRITICAL)** — every backend service function that touches per-user tables (`trades`, `alerts`, `portfolio_snapshots`, `ai_conversations`, `sync_log`) takes `userId` as its first argument and threads it into the Prisma `where` clause. Route handlers get `userId` from `req.user!.id` (guaranteed by `requireAuth`). The in-memory FIFO match cache in `pnl.service.ts` is keyed by `userId` — a single-key cache would leak one user's FIFO results to another within the 1-minute TTL. The `securities`, `market_prices`, and `exchange_rates` tables are shared and intentionally NOT scoped by user. AI tool executors have the signature `(userId, input) => Promise<unknown>` and the chat handler passes `req.user!.id` through `executeTool`.
- **Auth middleware** — `requireAuth` is mounted once via `app.use("/api", requireAuth)` in `apps/api/src/index.ts`, AFTER the public routes (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/*`). It checks the `takumi_session` cookie against the `sessions` table (SHA-256 of the raw value is stored), rejects expired or email-unverified sessions, and sets `req.user`. Rolling refresh: if the session hasn't been touched in >24h, its expiry is bumped by 30d (fire-and-forget).
- **TypeScript** for all Node.js code (ESM — `"type": "module"` everywhere)
- **File extensions in imports** — always use `.js` in TypeScript import paths (`./lib/config.js`)
- **Shared types** live in `@takumi/types`, not duplicated across apps
- **Prisma client** is re-exported from `@takumi/db` as a singleton (`packages/db/src/index.ts`)
- **API routes** follow `/api/<resource>` pattern
- **Frontend pages** are in `apps/web/src/app/<route>/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router, all `"use client"`)
- **Data fetching** on frontend uses TanStack Query (`useQuery`, `useMutation`)
- **API client** helper in `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts` — wraps `fetch` with base URL
- **Formatting** helpers in `apps/web/src/lib/formatters.ts` — `formatCurrency`, `formatDate`, `formatNumber`, `isHebrew`
- **RTL handling** — Hebrew security names wrapped with `<span dir="rtl">` using `isHebrew()` helper; applied in positions, analytics, and history pages
- **TASE security identification** — TASE securities use paper number (מספר נייר) as `ticker` and paper name (שם נייר) as `securityName`. US securities use standard ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL). The XLSX parser uses the symbol column (paper number) for TASE securities.
- **TASE price units** — IBI's `שער ביצוע` for Israeli securities is quoted in **agorot** (1/100 ILS), not shekels. The XLSX parser divides by 100 when `market === "TASE"` so `trades.price` is always per-share ILS. US trades are stored as-is. Sanity check: for any TASE buy/sell, `quantity × price + commission ≈ |proceedsIls|`. Migration script `scripts/fix-tase-prices.ts` corrects rows imported before this fix (idempotent, uses `rawPayload`).
- **Per-currency P&L** — `getPortfolioSummary()` returns `pnlByCurrency` array alongside `totalRealizedPnl`. Dashboard shows separate ILS/USD P&L lines. Never mix currencies in a single formatted amount.
- **ILS home currency for aggregation** — `position.service.ts` pre-computes `marketValueIls`, `totalCostIls`, `unrealizedPnlIls` on every `OpenPosition` using the current BOI USD/ILS rate (USD positions converted; ILS positions pass through 1:1). Portfolio weights and any cross-position aggregate (snapshot `totalValue`/`totalCostBasis`, analytics `totalOpenValue`, system-prompt portfolio context, AI `get_portfolio_summary.totalPortfolioValueIls`, AI `get_sector_exposure.marketValueIls`, Positions page summary strip) MUST use the `*Ils` fields. Summing native `marketValue` across ILS+USD inflates TASE weights by ~3.7× (USD magnitudes are naked). The per-position native `marketValue`/`unrealizedPnl` are still correct and used for per-row display in the native currency.
- **XLSX import** — `xlsx-import.service.ts` parses IBI Excel exports (Hebrew column headers), maps 23 transaction types to `Direction` enum, extracts real tickers from `שם נייר` patterns, generates deterministic `tradeId` hashes for dedup. Uses `source: "xlsx_import"`. Re-uploading same file is safe (upsert).
- **US ticker renames** — When IBI renames a US ticker (e.g. FIVG→SIXG, FB→META, KLTO→GRML, HUSA→AGIG) they update the historical rows' `symbol` (`מס' נייר / סימבול`) column to the new ticker but leave the `securityName` (שם נייר) untouched, so legacy BUY rows show `securityName="FIVG US"` with `symbol="SIXG"`. `parseSecurity` prefers `symbol` whenever it matches the US-ticker regex (`^[A-Z][A-Z0-9.-]{0,5}$`) over the ticker embedded in the name, so pre- and post-rename rows key to the same ticker in FIFO matching. Numeric symbols (IBI's internal id for delisted US ETFs like 29189461/24070908) stay on the name-based path. Migration for pre-fix data: `scripts/fix-renamed-tickers.ts` (idempotent, re-parses `rawPayload`).
- **Display-name caching** — `market.service.getLatestPrices` opportunistically upserts `securities.{ticker, name, market, currency, yahooSymbol}` from the Yahoo quote's `longName ?? shortName` on every successful fetch (fire-and-forget, failures logged but non-fatal). `position.service.getOpenPositions` and `stock-detail.service.getStockSummary` prefer `securities.name` over the trade's historical `securityName`, so post-rename rows show the current company name (e.g. "Meta Platforms, Inc." instead of IBI's stale "FACEBOOK(FB)"). This also improves every US position's label since IBI names tend to be ugly ("ISHARES COM(IAU" → "iShares Gold Trust"). Before this change the `securities` table was empty — it's populated live now.
- **Ticker-rename UX** — `StockSummary` now carries `priorNames: string[]` listing legacy `securityName` values from the user's own trades whose embedded ticker (e.g. "FB" in "FACEBOOK(FB)", "FIVG" in "FIVG US") differs from the current ticker. This filters out benign IBI-vs-Yahoo format mismatches like "ASTS US" vs "AST SpaceMobile, Inc." which are NOT renames. `StockHeader` renders a "Formerly known as …" subtitle when non-empty; `TradesTab` tags each pre-rename row with a muted "as FIVG US" under the date. Rename extraction lives in `extractEmbeddedTicker` in `stock-detail.service.ts`.
- **XLSX import writes are batched, not serial** — after parsing, the service pre-fetches which `tradeId`s already exist for this user+source, then does one bulk `prisma.trade.createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })` for brand-new rows and chunked parallel `prisma.trade.update()` calls (concurrency 10) for existing rows. Serial `upsert` per row hit Next.js' ~30s proxy timeout against a remote Postgres (each round-trip ~100ms on the Railway proxy from local dev × ~280 rows = ~80s → `ECONNRESET` / socket hang up in the browser, even though the API eventually finished). If you change the loop, keep it bulk/parallel or local-dev imports will break again.
- **Transaction linking** — Related transactions (e.g., dividend + tax withholding) share the same `ticker` and `tradeDate`. Query by ticker to see all related activity. No explicit `groupId` field.
- **Market data caching** — Yahoo Finance prices are cached in `market_prices` with 15-minute staleness. The `market.service.ts` checks cache first, fetches from Yahoo only for stale/missing tickers. On failure, serves stale cache. Benchmarks (TA-125, S&P 500) are cached the same way.
- **TASE ticker mapping** — TASE securities use IBI paper numbers as `ticker` (e.g., `1081820`), but Yahoo Finance requires trading symbols with `.TA` suffix (e.g., `LUMI.TA`). The mapping is maintained in `apps/api/src/data/tase-ticker-map.json` and synced to the `securities.yahooSymbol` column.
- **TheMarker Finance fallback** — TASE tickers without a Yahoo mapping (notably Israeli mutual funds / קרנות נאמנות which have no `.TA` trading symbol, e.g., `1143726`, `1169408`) fall back to TheMarker Finance. `themarker.service.ts` fetches `https://finance.themarker.com/stock/{paperId}`, parses the server-rendered Apollo cache from `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">`, and reads `ROOT_QUERY.assets({"ids":"<paperId>"}).0`. Prices are quoted in agorot and divided by 100 to normalize to ILS (same convention as IBI). No API key, no mapping — IBI paper number is the URL. Yahoo remains the primary source for mapped tickers (provides 52w high/low); TheMarker fills daily change/volume only. Also invoked if Yahoo returns no data for a mapped TASE ticker.
- **Stooq fallback (US)** — Yahoo Finance is unreliable from Railway (the `yahoo-finance2` crumb fetch to `fc.yahoo.com` frequently fails with `ETIMEDOUT` or 429, taking the whole library offline). `stooq.service.ts` is a reliable fallback for US equities and the S&P 500 (`^GSPC` → `^spx`). Endpoint: `https://stooq.com/q/l/?s=<sym>.us&f=spd2t2ohlcv` — CSV fields: symbol, prevClose, date, time, open, high, low, close, volume. `dayChange` derived as `close - prevClose`. Delayed ~15 min, no 52w high/low. Kicks in whenever Yahoo fails for a US ticker (per-ticker `No quote data` response OR the whole Yahoo call throwing). Does NOT cover TASE — TASE fallback is TheMarker.
- **Portfolio snapshots** — Auto-captured once per day after 15:00 UTC (~17:00 IST) on first API request. Also manually triggerable via `POST /api/snapshots/capture`. One snapshot per calendar day (upsert on date).
- **AI chat** — Persistent right-side drawer (400px on ≥md, full-width on mobile). Uses Zustand store (`chat-store.ts`) for state, SSE streaming from `POST /api/chat`. Messages rendered with `react-markdown`. Tool calls shown as collapsible indicators. Each `ChatMessage` carries an `isStreaming` flag — set true on the empty assistant placeholder so `MessageBubble` shows a typing-dots indicator before the first chunk arrives, flipped false on `done`/`error`/abort. Cancelling: `chat-store.stopStreaming()` aborts the in-flight `fetchSSE` via `AbortController`; `ChatInput` swaps Send for a Stop button while `isStreaming`. SSE travels through a Next.js Route Handler at `apps/web/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` (NOT the rewrite) — Web Streams flush per-event, whereas the rewrite proxy was buffering chunks behind Railway's edge.
- **Responsive layout** — Mobile-first. Sidebar is a fixed 240px column on ≥md and collapses to an off-canvas drawer on <md (hamburger in TopBar, state in `ui-store.ts`). ChatDrawer is full-width on <md, 400px on ≥md. Tables wrap in `overflow-x-auto` containers. Grid layouts use `grid-cols-{1|2} … lg:grid-cols-4` pattern. Main padding is `p-3 sm:p-6`. Viewport meta set via `viewport` export in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`.
- **AI tool architecture** — Tools defined in `apps/api/src/ai/tools/` grouped by tier. Each file exports schemas (Anthropic format) + executor map. Registry in `tools/index.ts` combines all. Chat handler in `ai/chat-handler.ts` runs the agentic loop (stream → detect tool_use → execute → stream again).
- **FIFO caching** — `runFifoMatching()` results cached in-memory with 1-minute TTL to avoid redundant re-computation when multiple AI tools call it within the same chat turn.
- **Stock detail page** — `/positions/:ticker` is backed by `stock-detail.service.ts` + `routes/stock.ts` and composes existing services (trade, pnl, position, market, exchange-rate). `StockSummary` aggregates per-currency realized P&L, commissions paid, and dividends (with tax withheld). The service does NOT run its own SQL queries for P&L/lots — it filters the cached `runFifoMatching()` output via `getMatchedLotsForTicker()` / `getOpenLotsForTicker()`. Currency impact (USD tickers only) decomposes unrealized P&L into "price move" vs "FX move" per open FIFO lot using historical BOI rates from `getRate(buyDate)`. The small interaction term is folded into price-move so the two components sum to the total unrealized ILS P&L cleanly. URL uses `encodeURIComponent(ticker)` everywhere — TASE paper numbers like `1081820` are fine as URL segments.
- **Historical price chart** — `market.service.getHistoricalPrices(ticker, market, from, to)` returns daily closes via `yahoo-finance2.chart()` (primary) with `stooq.service.fetchStooqHistorical()` as the US fallback. Unmapped TASE tickers (TheMarker-only) return `{ available: false, reason: 'unmapped_tase' }` — TheMarker exposes only current quote, no history. Results cached in-memory for 24h keyed by `ticker|from|to`. `StockChart.tsx` renders a Recharts `LineChart` with `<ReferenceDot>` per BUY (green) / SELL (red) executed-price marker and a dashed `<ReferenceLine>` at the current avg cost (only when position is open). Buy/sell dates that fall on market holidays snap to the nearest prior data point so markers still render on the X axis (category scale). No new `price_history` DB table — persistent OHLCV storage is deferred to Phase 5.

## Deployment (Railway)

Hosted on Railway at https://web-production-7a48c.up.railway.app — project ID `3a1f80a2-97df-4762-9187-4e6cf4781e76`. Three services: `web`, `api`, `Postgres`.

**Access** — Email + password with email verification (Resend). Session cookies (`takumi_session`) are validated on every API request. The previous HTTP Basic Auth layer was removed in the multi-user migration. The primary user (`nitzan.lary@gmail.com`) was created and backfilled with all pre-migration data by `scripts/bootstrap-users.ts`.

**Service topology:**
- `web` (Next.js) — only service with a public domain. `src/middleware.ts` redirects unauthenticated requests (no session cookie) to `/login`. `next.config.mjs` rewrites `/api/:path*` to `${API_URL}/api/:path*` server-side, where `API_URL=http://${{api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{api.PORT}}`.
- `api` (Express) — private-only (no public domain). Explicitly listens on `::` (IPv6+IPv4) which Railway's private networking requires. `PORT=3001` must be set as a service variable so `${{api.PORT}}` resolves in the web service's `API_URL`.
- `Postgres` — managed plugin, referenced as `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` from api.

**Deploy flow:**
- We now deploy by pushing to GitHub — Railway auto-deploys on push to `master`.
- API build: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false && pnpm --filter @takumi/db exec prisma generate`.
- API preDeploy: `pnpm --filter @takumi/db exec prisma db push && pnpm --filter @takumi/api run bootstrap-users` (schema sync + idempotent primary-user bootstrap; script is a no-op after first successful run).
- API start: `pnpm --filter @takumi/api start` (uses `tsx`, not a compiled `dist/`, so workspace TypeScript deps work).
- Web build: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false && pnpm --filter @takumi/web build`.
- Web start: `pnpm --filter @takumi/web start` → `next start -H ::`.

**Required service variables:**

| Service | Variable | Value |
|---|---|---|
| api | `DATABASE_URL` | `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` |
| api | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude key |
| api | `PORT` | `3001` (explicit, so `${{api.PORT}}` resolves for web's `API_URL`) |
| api | `APP_URL` | Public URL of the web service — used in verification + reset emails |
| api | `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key for transactional email (unset = log-only) |
| api | `EMAIL_FROM` | `"Takumi <onboarding@resend.dev>"` (or your verified domain sender) |
| api | `BOOTSTRAP_USER_EMAIL` / `BOOTSTRAP_USER_PASSWORD` | One-time, consumed by bootstrap-users.ts. Safe to leave set — script is idempotent. |
| web | `API_URL` | `http://${{api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{api.PORT}}` |

**Local dev vs prod** — `API_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:3001`. Same `/api/*` paths work locally via the same rewrite. For local dev without running the full auth flow, set `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS_USER_ID` on the api service to your user's id — `requireAuth` will resolve that user without a session cookie. NEVER set this in prod.

## External Services

| Service | Purpose | Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resend | Transactional email (verification, password reset) | 5 | **Active** | REST API called directly (no SDK). No-op when `RESEND_API_KEY` unset — logs the email instead. |
| Yahoo Finance (`yahoo-finance2` v3) | Live prices, benchmarks (TA-125, S&P 500) | 3 | **Active** | TASE tickers resolved via `tase-ticker-map.json` → `.TA` suffix. 15-min cache staleness. |
| TheMarker Finance (scrape) | Price fallback for unmapped TASE tickers (mutual funds) | 3 | **Active** | Scrapes `finance.themarker.com/stock/{paperId}` `__NEXT_DATA__` Apollo cache. No auth, no mapping. Agorot → ILS. No 52w high/low. |
| Stooq (CSV API) | Price fallback for US tickers + S&P 500 when Yahoo is blocked | 3 | **Active** | `https://stooq.com/q/l/?s=<sym>.us&f=spd2t2ohlcv`. No auth. Delayed ~15 min. Derives `dayChange` from prevClose. No 52w high/low. |
| Bank of Israel SDMX API | Official daily ILS/USD exchange rates | 3 | **Active** | Free, no auth. Backfills into `exchange_rates` table. Endpoint: `edge.boi.gov.il/FusionEdgeServer/sdmx/v2/data/dataflow/BOI/EXR/1.0/` |
| Finnhub | News headlines, earnings calendar, corporate events | 5 | Planned | Free tier: 60 calls/min. Cache in `security_events` table. |

## AI Agent Data Enrichment Tiers

See PRD Section 7.5 for full details. Summary:

- **Tier 1 (Phase 4)**: No external APIs — dividend aggregation, cost analysis, performance attribution, streaks, sector metadata, holding period analysis. All derived from existing `trades` table data.
- **Tier 2 (Phase 3 infra + Phase 4 tools)**: External APIs — live prices, benchmarks, exchange rates, risk metrics, portfolio snapshots. Market data services built in Phase 3; agent tools that consume them ship in Phase 4.
- **Tier 3 (Phase 5)**: Advanced — technical indicators, news/events, tax intelligence. Requires Finnhub + daily OHLCV history.

**Total agent tools**: 24 (11 core + 7 Tier 1 + 3 Tier 2 + 3 Tier 3 + `get_tax_report`).

**DB tables added in Phase 3**: `portfolio_snapshots`. **Planned new tables**: `price_history` (Phase 5), `security_events` (Phase 5). Existing `securities` table extended with `yahooSymbol`, `industry`, `marketCapBucket` (Phase 3). Existing `market_prices` extended with `dayChange`, `dayChangePct`, `high52w`, `low52w`, `volume` (Phase 3).

## Gotchas

- `DATABASE_URL` must be **absolute** `file:` path — relative paths break when commands run from different directories
- Express `.env` loading uses hardcoded relative path in `config.ts` — update if you move the file
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` has `onlyBuiltDependencies` for prisma and esbuild — add new native packages there if they need build scripts
- Next.js `create-next-app` generated some files we don't use (e.g., `public/` SVGs) — safe to ignore
- Positions page shows live prices from Yahoo Finance for mapped tickers. TASE tickers without a mapping in `tase-ticker-map.json` fall back to placeholder prices (= avg cost basis). Use `GET /api/market/unmapped` or `POST /api/market/map` to manage mappings.
- Pre-existing TS2742 errors in Express routes due to `declaration: true` + Express 5 type inference — does not affect runtime (tsx skips type checking)
- **Transaction filtering**: XLSX import stores ALL transaction types (trades, dividends, fees, taxes, etc.) in the `trades` table. Only `BUY`/`SELL` directions are "core trades" used by P&L, positions, analytics, and the default trades API. Non-trade types are preserved for future processing. The relevant IBI סוג פעולה values for core trades are: `קניה רצף` (TASE buy), `מכירה רצף` (TASE sell), `קניה חול מטח` (US buy), `מכירה חול מטח` (US sell), `מכירה הצעת רכש` (tender-offer sell), `פדיון סופי` (bond/MAKAM final redemption — treated as SELL so the matching BUY lot closes in FIFO), plus `קניה שח` / `מכירה שח` when the security is a TASE mutual fund (see next bullet). `CORE_DIRECTIONS` constant in `@takumi/types` defines `['BUY', 'SELL']`.
- **DIRECTION_MAP must cover every IBI `סוג פעולה` value** — any row with a type not in the map is skipped and logged as "Unknown transaction type" in Import History (partial status). When a new account surfaces unfamiliar Hebrew types, add them to `DIRECTION_MAP` in `xlsx-import.service.ts`. Known non-trade extras already handled: `דיבידנד בעין` → BONUS (stock distribution / in-kind dividend), `הפחתת הון` → SPLIT (capital reduction, often negative qty), `הפקדה המרה` / `משיכה המרה` → CONVERSION (corporate-action ticker change, paired rows), `קניה מס (( ניעז)` → TAX (withholding on in-kind dividend — note IBI's literal double `((`, single `)`), `משיכת עמלה מטח` → FEE (FX commission), `ריבית מזומן בשח` → INTEREST (interest on cash balance).
- **XLSX שם נייר patterns** — The XLSX parser extracts tickers from security name prefixes: `דיב/` (dividend), `מסח/` (dividend tax), `מס/` (tax), `COMPANY(TICKER)` (trade), `TICKER US` (trade). FX conversions use `B USD/ILS X.XXX`. TASE uses paper numbers. Admin uses code 900 plus the full 999xxxx range (`/^9{3}\d{4}$/`) — e.g., 9992975, 9992983, 9993975, 9993983 are all tax/admin pseudo-tickers.
- **`קניה שח` / `מכירה שח` disambiguation** — IBI reuses these two action types for three unrelated events: (a) FX conversions on `B USD/ILS X.XXX` rows, (b) TASE mutual-fund buys/sells paid in shekels (funds like 5124573 that don't trade continuously so don't use `קניה רצף` / `מכירה רצף`), and (c) tax/admin entries on 999xxxx codes. The parser defaults both to `CONVERSION`/`CREDIT` (FX case) and `refineDirection` promotes them to `BUY`/`SELL` when `parseSecurity` classifies the row as `TASE`. Without this refinement TASE mutual-fund positions are invisible to /positions and analytics. Migration script for pre-fix data: `scripts/fix-tase-shekel-trades.ts` (idempotent, re-parses `rawPayload`).
